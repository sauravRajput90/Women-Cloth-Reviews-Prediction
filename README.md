# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

## Title of Project: Women Cloth Reviews Prediction with Multi-Nomial Naïve Bayes  
This project aims to predict the sentiment of women’s clothing reviews using a Multi-Nomial Naïve Bayes classifier. By analyzing customer reviews, we can gain insights into customer satisfaction and preferences, which can help improve product offerings and customer service.  

## Objectives
*  __Sentiment Analysis:__ Develop a model to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of clothing reviews.  
*  __Customer Insights:__ Identify key factors that influence customer satisfaction.  
*  __Product Improvement:__ Provide actionable insights to help improve product quality and customer experience.

## Data Description
The dataset used for this project contains information about women’s clothing reviews, including:  

*  __Clothing ID:__ Unique identifier for each piece of clothing.  
*  __Age:__ Age of the reviewer.  
*  __Title:__ Title of the review.  
*  __Review:__ Text of the review.  
*  __Rating:__ Rating given by the reviewer (1 to 5).  
*  __Recommended:__ Whether the reviewer recommends the product (1 = Yes, 0 = No).  
*  __Positive Feedback:__ Number of positive feedbacks received.  
*  __Division:__ Division of the product (e.g., General, General Petite, Initmates).  
*  __Department:__ Department of the product (e.g., Dresses, Tops).  
*  __Category:__ Category of the product (e.g., Dresses, Blouses).

## Methodology
### 1-Data Preprocessing:  
* Handle missing values.  
* Clean and preprocess text data (e.g., remove stop words, tokenize).  
* Encode categorical variables.  
### 2-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
* Visualize data distributions.  
* Analyze the distribution of ratings and recommendations.  
### 3-Model Development:  
* Split the data into training and testing sets.  
* Train a Multi-Nomial Naïve Bayes classifier.  
* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
### 4-Model Evaluation:  
* Compare model performance with baseline models.  
* Select the best-performing model.  
### 5-Feature Importance:  
* Identify the most important features influencing sentiment.  
### 6-Deployment:  
* Deploy the model using a web application (e.g., Flask, Streamlit) for real-time sentiment analysis.

## Conclusion
The Women Cloth Reviews Prediction Model provides valuable insights into customer sentiment and helps identify areas for product improvement. By understanding the key factors that drive customer satisfaction, the company can enhance its product offerings and customer service.

## Future Work
*  __Model Improvement:__ Explore advanced techniques such as ensemble learning and hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
*  __Feature Engineering:__ Create new features based on domain knowledge to enhance the model’s predictive power.
*  __Real-Time Predictions:__ Integrate the model into the company’s review system for real-time sentiment analysis.
